# I Have Struggled and I Hope This Is It.
<p>I have read through many docs for three nights as I was unable to do so in day time
  but I think this is it. So here is what I have done today</p>
  
   - 1: I have created two different branches, one called Master and the other called gh-pages.
   - 2: I have assigned each of my branches to different repositories
   - 3: I changed the tribute page for Malcolm X's README file from .md to .file, 
 
 # I really hope this works now. And to those of you struggling, don't give up. There's a light beyond the dark.
